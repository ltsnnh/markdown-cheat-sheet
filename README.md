# Markdown Guide

I really like using Markdown.  
I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

## Basic syntax

### Emphasis

I just love **bold text**  
But I love *italicized text* too  
This text is very ***important***

### Blockquote

>This is block quote.
>
>Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.  
>The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
>>*Everything* is going according to **plan**.

### List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item

- First item

    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item

- 1997\. A great year!
- I think 1999 was second best.

* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.

### Code block

At the command prompt, type `nano`.

``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``

    int main() {
        return 0;
    }

1. Open the file.
2. Find the following code block on line 21:

        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Test</title>
          </head>

3. Update the title to match the name of your website.
